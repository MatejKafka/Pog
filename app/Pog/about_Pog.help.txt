POG: A PORTABLE PACKAGE MANAGER

Pog is an in-development package manager for Windows, written for PowerShell 5. Unlike
most existing Windows package managers, which delegate to existing program installers,
Pog manages the whole package installation process end-to-end, preferring installation
from package archives instead. The packages are encapsulated by redirecting their
default data directories to a package-local directory, This also provides first-class
support for portable packages, which can be moved between machines without reinstallation.


BASIC USAGE

Install a package (use Tab to get a list of matching packages):

    pog <PackageName>

Uninstall a package:

    Uninstall-Pog <PackageName>
