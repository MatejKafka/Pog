POG: A PORTABLE PACKAGE MANAGER

Pog is an in-development package manager for Windows, written for PowerShell 5. Unlike
most existing Windows package managers, which delegate to existing program installers,
Pog manages the whole package installation process end-to-end, preferring installation
from package archives instead. The packages are encapsulated by redirecting their
default data directories to a package-local directory, This also provides first-class
support for portable packages, which can be moved between machines without reinstallation.


BASIC USAGE

Install a package (press `Ctrl+Space` while typing to get a list of matching packages):

    pog <PackageName>

Update a package to the latest version:

    pog <PackageName> # same as first-time installation

Install a specific version of a package:

    pog <PackageName> <Version>

Install two separate versions of a package:

    # latest version of 7zip under the default name `7zip`
    pog 7zip
    # version 19.0 under the name `7zip-19.0`
    pog 7zip 19.0 -TargetName 7zip-19.0

Uninstall a package:

    Uninstall-Pog <PackageName>

List packages:

    Get-PogPackage # list installed packages
    Find-PogPackage # list available packages

Modify the list of portable package directories (opens a text editor):

    Edit-PogRootList

Create a new local package:

    New-PogPackage <PackageName>

Use a custom package repository:

    Set-PogRepository <Path> # to use a local repository
    Set-PogRepository -Uri <Uri> # to use a remote repository

Get help for any Pog command using the PowerShell help system:

    man <CommandName>
