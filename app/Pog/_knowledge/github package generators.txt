Github cmdlets:
- pass name of github repository
- lists matching release versions (new/all/selected), with support for filters, automatically parses version (e.g. stripping out "v" prefix?)
- retrieves download URLs (using a regex like '.*windows.*\.exe'? figure out how to support multiple resources, e.g. Alacritty)
- has parameters indicating how to retrieve the hash:
 - download the file and calculate the hash
 - scriptblock that returns the URL of a checksums.txt or a similar file
 - custom scriptblock that receives hashtable of Version/Url and returns the hash (e.g. custom checksum file format,
   copying hash from another package manager repo,...)



@{
	GithubRepo = "obsproject/obs-studio"
	FileNamePattern = "OBS-Studio-*-Full-x64.zip"
	Checksum = "Calculate"
}

Get-GithubRelease "obsproject/obs-studio" -FileName "OBS-Studio-*-Full-x64.zip" -Checksum Calculate



how hashes are presented for a github release:
- CHECKSUMS.txt (or similar) 22
- they aren't, small archive 30
- they aren't, medium archive 12
- they aren't, large archive 11
