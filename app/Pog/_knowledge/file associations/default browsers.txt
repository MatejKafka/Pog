how to add an entry to the "default browser" Settings UI:
	- see `default browsers.reg`
	- RegisteredApplications seems to be a fixed location and the app won't be picked up from anywhere else
		- there's a HKCU: and HKLM: version
	- the path stored in RegisteredApplications is an arbitrary subdir of HKCU:
	- the value stored in URLAssociations is resolved from HKCR:, and it must not be in a subdirectory or contain
	  any unusual characters in the name (e.g. :), otherwise the Settings UI breaks (probably a UI bug)

the user choice is stored in the following keys as a (Hash, ProgID) pair:
	HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Associations\UrlAssociations\http\UserChoice
	HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Associations\UrlAssociations\https\UserChoice
