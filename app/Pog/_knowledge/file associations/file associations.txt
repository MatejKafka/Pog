priorities
	1. `HKCU\Software\Classes\.testfile\shell\open\command` is the default, apparently lowest-priority
	2. when a (Default) in the previous key is set to `testfile_auto` and
	   `HKCU\Software\Classes\testfile_auto\shell\open\command` is created, it completely overrides the previous value 
	3. when a value is added to the list in `HKCU\Software\Classes\.testfile\OpenWithProgids`,
	   it overrides the shell\open\command path from 1., but 2. is kept as a default and has higher priority;
	   however, after a key is added here, the Open With popup is shown next time the user
		tries to open a file with the `.testfile` extension
	4. OpenWithProgids subkey in `...\testfile_auto` is completely ignored
	5. whenever a file is opened, an entry for the extension is created in `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.testfile`
		- `OpenWithProgids` subkey initially only contains the original shell association from 2. as property (not Default!)
		- `OpenWithList` is initially empty; when user manually selects app in the Open With popup without checking the 
		  "Always use this..." checkbox, it is added here with letter-based indexing of entries
	6. when user explicitly selects a new default application, a new `UserChoice` is created under 5.
		- `ProgId` contains an application name from HKCR\Applications (but without the usual `Applications` prefix)
		- `Hash` is an automatically computed checksum value that lets the shell validate that no one changed the entry
		- if `UserChoice` is set, and the ProgId is valid, this overrides previously listed entries


"Open with" menu
	TODO: this is possibly incomplete, investigate more
	for a program to appear in the "Open with" menu, it should be:
	 1. present under FileExts\...\OpenWithList
	 2. the target should either be a binary which has the FileDescription and CompanyName filled out,
	    or an entry for .ApplicationCompany with any value must be added to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\MuiCache;
	    .FriendlyAppName should also be added here for consistency, but note that the entry value is
	    not used if the following key exists: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\...\FriendlyAppName
	NOTE: creating the MuiCache entries manually is probably not a good solution, as the internet says that it is periodically flushed (didn't encounter that yet personally)

TODO: DefaultIcon in HKCR\Applications doesn't seem to work; figure out how should we override app icon


in code, use HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes, not HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
%1 should be quoted in all verb commands (apparently, there are never quotes by default)

 When you’re installing your shell extension, you need to know which progid to hang it off of inside HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. We’ll start with the title question and then move on to other predefined (but perhaps not well-known) progids.

    “Folder” is the progid for any shell folder. It could be a virtual folder (like Control Panel) or a file system folder (like C:\WINDOWS).
    “Directory” is the progid for file system folders. This is a subset of “Folder”.
    “*” is the progid for all files. Doesn’t matter what the extension is.
    “.” (that’s a single period) is the progid for files without any extension.
    “AllFileSystemObjects” is the union of “*” and “Directory”. It is the progid for all files and for file system directories.
