the `app` directory can be moved while Pog is running from it, it just cannot be deleted
however, the first time we attempt to load something from the app directory (e.g. container Env_*.psm1), it will fail

we could do a custom update system, which
1) ensures that no other PowerShell instance has Pog loaded
2) moves `app` to `app-old`
3) unpacks the new version, WITHOUT loading any pwsh file or dll (must not call the container)
	the hard part
4) configures the new Pog version (ideally by running `Enable`, but that's gonna be hard)
5) launches a detached background process which waits until user closes the last loaded Pog instance and then deletes the old directory
6) prompt the user to close the current shell

TODO: still quite wonky, check how other similar software does it
