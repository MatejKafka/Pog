GraphQL api is unusable without authentication
REST api allows 60 requests/hour, which is not enough to rely on it much

as an alternative, we can generate GitHub Pages from CI, with the following files:
  combined listing json file for all versions of all packages
    cache in memory for 10 minutes (for now, no file caching; in the future, use SharedFileCache)
  generate zip archive at /<PackageName>/<Version>.zip
    client downloads it, reads the manifest and keeps the zip file in memory
    for now, do not cache these (in the future, add them to SharedFileCache)
    all remote repository packages are direct packages, templated packages are expanded in CI
  TODO: if retrieving any of the supposedly existing versions fails, invalidate the package listing
  TODO: support ETag or If-Modified-Since to avoid needlessly redownloading stuff

TODO: figure out caching
  create a separate download cache for package lists
  github sends ETag and correctly checks If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since
  at least cache available packages (how long? 10 minutes?)
  probably also cache manifests, and link them with the download cache
    meaning, either there should be the manifest and resources needed for installation, or there should be neither
      (except for the initial gap between downloading the manifest and the resources)

GraphQL query to get list of packages:

    object(expression: "master:") {
      ... on Tree {

          name
